The individual parts of this code are in need of explanation. In the helloworld.nools object there is a single object defined called Message. This object has two elements defined; the text property and the constructor. The specific object definition is shown below.

define Message {
    text : '',
    constructor : function(message){
        this.text = message;
    }
}

This object can now be referred to by name throughout the nools file. The other way to reference this object is to call the getDefined function from the flow object that is being used in code processing the business rules. In the nools language any javascript has can be put inside the define blog. By defining the constructor as shown, it overrides the default constructor behavior.




It's like Decoration of the message objects.
